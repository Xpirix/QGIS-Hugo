## Before download starts

Our software is, and always will be, available free of charge if downloaded from QGIS.org.

The project is a result of a huge effort and social contribution from many community members who volunteer their time and expertise. In addition, many businesses, government agencies and commercial entities have contributed to the development of QGIS. They do this either to ensure that QGIS meets their specific needs or to contribute to and accelerate the huge social impact that is realised by making a tool such as QGIS freely available. Our goal is the betterment of society through informed spatial decision making. If you are able, we gently request that you support our work.

Whether you choose to donate or not, we hope that you enjoy using our labour of love and encourage you to share and spread your downloaded copy far and wide so that others may enjoy it too.

Our very best regards!

##### Tips for first launch
After installing QGIS, the first launch attempt may fail due to Apple's security framework. To enable QGIS, command-click on its icon in your Applications folder and select 'Open' in the context menu. A confirmation dialog will display where you need to click the 'Open' button again. This only has to be done once.
